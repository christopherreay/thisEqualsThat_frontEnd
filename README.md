# visual.tools

Visual Tools is a complete pipeline for the presentation of complex data.

## Justification

At visual.tools we believe that for the World to evolve properly, everybody must have access to accurate data, and to tools with which they can understand and communicate information relevant to their lives.

## Design
### Data Acquisition
* Each collection in the visual.tools data store is called a "blueprint"
  * Blueprints encode three significant sets of data
    * Relationships between fields
      * e.g. Volume = Mass * Density; CO2 = emissionsPerKM * Distance; etc
    * How to visualise those interactions to the user
      * e.g. the volume of a cube of CO2 against the Eiffel Tower; the size of a piece of wood against an ant
    * How to build an interface to allow the user to interact naturally with the relationships
      * e.g. readable field names; descriptions of fields; sensible defaults and limits on values
  
 
 
The visual.tools data store provides for import from accessible data source, for both stored and live linked data. 
* 

The focus of visual tools is not so much on data acquisition and homogonisation, but on presentation. We seek to enable individuals and businesses to create effective, impactful visualisations of systems of equations, or linked data, or any other source of valuable knowledge.

If you have any questions about usage or developing more tools into the pipeline, please drop us a line. Documentation will follow... by maybe Spring 2017
